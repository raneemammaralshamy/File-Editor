# File Editor Using Computer Vision

It is a program that provides reading files in PDF format with advantages defined by the user such as changing the background color, changing the color of the writing, placing a mark at the place where the user wishes to complete the reading from him, and capturing the screen through the movement of the eyes, using Computer Vision.

## Features
Build a program that provides safe and comfortable reading of pdf files.
Where we insert a file in pdf format to it, and the program basically provides the following:
- Reading in a comfortable position for the eyes, which is completely similar to the position found in most smart devices.
- Converting the background of the pages to a color chosen by the user.
- Convert the writing to a color suitable for the user.
- Marking a place on the page within the book to continue reading from it later (it is possible to mark a page or a place on a page).
- The possibility of gradual movement between pages depending on the movement of the iris of the eye.
- The ability to take a screenshot through the eyes.
